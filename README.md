### **[Trivia Night! | A Kotlin, Spring Boot + WebSockets Project](https://github.com/kyle-t01/multiplayer_live_quiz)**

Built a full stack real-time multiplayer quiz app using Kotlin, Spring Boot, and Web Sockets. Players join a lobby, then participate in timed quizzes with real-time score updates. The game loop and quiz timers were handled using Kotlin coroutines. App is containerised with Docker, and automatically deployed via a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to an AWS EC2 instance when code has been commit. It uses Redis for backend coordination, and Kubernetes (Minikube) for horizontal scaling of WebSocket pods.

- Create recos with the help of AI
- Organise and share Recos effortlessly with your mates, eliminating endless reposting and in group chats
